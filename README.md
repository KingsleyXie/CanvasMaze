# CanvasMaze
Naive Maze Emulator With HTML5 Canvas API, refactored from my another [Repository](https://github.com/KingsleyXie/Maze).

## Todos
This is a temporary version, there are still a lot of things to do, such as...emmmm...

- Modal for user customizations, such as maze size, path color, interval time, etc.
- Adapter for mobile devices.
- ~~Sounds similar as [FlappyFrog](https://github.com/tusenpo/FlappyFrog) to make the search process more exciting~~.
